## Special Thanks

This sample code wouldn't have been possible without the resources from [uofw on GitHub](https://github.com/uofw/uofw) and the PSP homebrew community, which served as valuable sources of knowledge.
Thanks especially to **crazyc** from ps2dev.org, without whom the use of the Media Engine in the community would be impossible.
Thanks to all developers and contributors who have kept the scene alive and to those who continue to do so.
